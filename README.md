# CleaningManagerProj

Java files are implemented by me (Data Structures & Algorithms Focused)

Model: Reporter.java CleaningManager.java

View: CleaningManagerUI.java (Used to create a basic console interface using in white box testing)

Black- Box Test: ReportManagerTest.java (Used to for black box testing both the report and cleaning manager classes)

Jar Files: CleaningManager.jar file was provided by the instructors and teaching staff for the more basic or trivial classes necessary for complete funcinality of the program.

DataStructures.jar file was taken from the implementation of the various data structures we had completed prior to this project. Data strcuture implemetnations were based on the Data Structures & Aglorithms Textbook (Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Java-6th-Edition)
